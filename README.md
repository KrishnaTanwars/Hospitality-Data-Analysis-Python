# 🏨 Hospitality Data Analysis Using Python

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking performance using **Python**, including occupancy trends, revenue distribution, booking behavior, room categories, and city-wise performance.  
The analysis is done through multiple datasets such as *dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_bookings,* and *fact_aggregated_bookings*.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore hospitality data through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and generate insights that help hotels understand:

- City-wise occupancy performance  
- Revenue contribution by booking platforms  
- Booking trends and customer behavior  
- Room category demand  
- Cancellations and no-shows  

Using Python libraries, this project converts raw hotel datasets into meaningful business insights.

## 📈 Key Visual Insights

### **1️⃣ City-wise Occupancy Comparison**
A bar chart comparing average occupancy %, showing:  
- **Delhi** has the highest occupancy  
- Followed by **Hyderabad**, **Mumbai**, and **Bangalore**  
This helps identify strong vs underperforming cities.

### **2️⃣ Revenue by Booking Platform**
A pie chart showing revenue contribution from each platform:  
- *Others* and *MakeYourTrip* contribute the largest share  
- Followed by *Logtrip, Journey, Direct Online, Direct Offline,* and *Tripster*  
Useful for identifying the most profitable channels.

---

## 🔍 Insights Generated

- Delhi leads in occupancy while Bangalore shows room for improvement  
- Majority of hotel revenue comes from OTA platforms like MakeYourTrip  
- Direct offline bookings contribute the lowest revenue  
- Clear seasonality visible in booking behavior (from EDA)  
- Room categories differ widely in occupancy and demand patterns
