# 🏨 Hospitality Data Analysis Using Python  
**Project Type:** Python  
**Domain:** Hospitality Analytics / Data Analysis  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking and performance data using Python to generate actionable insights for the hospitality industry.  
The analysis covers occupancy trends, revenue patterns, booking behavior, cancellations, and room category performance across multiple cities.

Using structured datasets and exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project demonstrates how raw hospitality data can be transformed into business-ready insights that support revenue optimization and occupancy management.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze city-wise occupancy performance  
- Identify revenue contribution by booking platforms  
- Understand booking behavior and customer trends  
- Evaluate room category demand  
- Study cancellations and no-show patterns  
- Highlight seasonality and demand fluctuations

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization and comparative analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis and reporting  

---

## 📂 Datasets Used

The analysis is performed using multiple structured datasets:

- `dim_date.csv` – Date and time dimensions  
- `dim_hotels.csv` – Hotel-level details  
- `dim_rooms.csv` – Room categories and attributes  
- `fact_bookings.csv` – Booking-level transactional data  
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv` – Aggregated booking metrics  
- `new_data_august.csv` – Additional booking data for extended analysis

## 📊 Key Analysis & Visual Insights

### 1️⃣ City-wise Occupancy Analysis
- Compared average occupancy percentages across cities  
- **Delhi** recorded the highest occupancy, followed by **Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore**  
- Helps identify high-demand vs underperforming locations  

### 2️⃣ Revenue Distribution by Booking Platform
- Analyzed revenue contribution across booking channels  
- OTA platforms (e.g., **MakeYourTrip**) contribute the majority of revenue  
- Direct offline bookings show the lowest contribution  
- Useful for channel strategy and marketing optimization  

### 3️⃣ Booking Behavior & Trends
- Identified seasonal patterns and demand fluctuations  
- Observed variations between weekday and weekend bookings  

### 4️⃣ Room Category Performance
- Analyzed occupancy and demand across room types  
- Revealed significant differences in room-level utilization  

### 5️⃣ Cancellations & No-Shows
- Studied cancellation patterns to understand booking reliability  
- Helps hotels improve forecasting and operational planning

## 🔍 Key Insights Generated

- High occupancy cities can be leveraged for premium pricing strategies  
- OTA platforms are the primary revenue drivers  
- Certain cities and room categories have untapped growth potential  
- Clear seasonality impacts booking volume and occupancy  
- Direct booking channels require strategic improvement
